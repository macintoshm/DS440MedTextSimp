 This review of brain scans shows that there is evidence that the brain is growing extra extra extra brain mass at the level of the posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes. This extra extra mass encases the falx and the adjacent superior sagittal sinus. There is no evidence that it is causing side effects such as brain damage or brain damage to the brain. However, there is some evidence to suggest that it might be associated to cancer of the brain and that it may be associated with lymphoma. Other less likely considerations include extra-axial dural based tumour based metastasis, lymphoma and less likely solitary fibrous tumor.  This review shows that the brain shows evidence that the extra-axial mass encases the lower part of the brain and the middle of the upper part (the ventricles, sulci and basal cisterns) of the skull. The brain shows signs that there is no evidence that there has been any brain damage to the brain. There is not enough evidence to say if there is evidence of brain damage caused by meningioma. However, there is some evidence that it may have been caused by lymphoma and lymphoma is more likely to cause brain damage. Other less likely considerations include extra brain metastases, lymphoma or lymphoma caused by bone cancer and less likely solitary fibrous tumor. More research is needed.
