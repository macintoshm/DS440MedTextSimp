This is an updated version of an earlier version of this review.
----------------------------------------
This is a rare condition of the fifth metacarpal.
----------------------------------------
The fracture is a small, short-lived fracture that is thought to be caused by a single fracture. The fracture is about 4 cm in length with bright T2 and intermediate T1 signal.
----------------------------------------
There is no evidence to support the existence of a new species.
----------------------------------------
The findings are consistent with an enchondroma.
----------------------------------------
This is a non-fractured fracture of the fifth metacarpal muscle of the enchondroma.
----------------------------------------
Mild tenosynovitis of the fourth and fifth flexor tendon sheaths.
----------------------------------------
The flexor and extensor tendons are otherwise normal.
----------------------------------------
The osseous structures of the right hand are otherwise normal.
----------------------------------------
The musculature of the right hand is normal.
----------------------------------------
This is a small lesion of the fifth metacarpal shaft measuring approximately 2.4 cm in length.
----------------------------------------
This is a picture of an enchondroma, a type of cystoscopy.
----------------------------------------
This is a fracture of the fifth metacarpal near the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the shaft with minimal adjacent periostitis representing a pathologic fracture.
----------------------------------------
There is a small amount of bleeding on the surface of the back of the leg and this appears to represent an acute injury.
----------------------------------------
Minimal tenosynovitis fourth and fifth digit flexor tendon sheaths.
