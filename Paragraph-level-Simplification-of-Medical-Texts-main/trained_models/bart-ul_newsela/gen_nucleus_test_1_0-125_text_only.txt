 This review of 38 studies involving 7843 children found that providing education aimed at children, their parents or both, can reduce the risk of future emergency department visits and hospital admissions. However, there is uncertainty as to the long-term effect of education on other markers of asthma morbidity such as quality of life, symptoms and lung function. It remains unclear as to what type, duration and intensity of educational packages are the most effective in reducing acute care utilisation.
----------------------------------------
 This review includes 130 studies with 8341 participants. Ketamine was given by intravenous infusion to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used non-stratified analysis. Most studies had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity, as expected, for most analyses. We found low-quality evidence that ketamine reduced pain at rest, pain during movement, pain after movement, postoperative nausea, nausea, vomiting, or postoperative hyperalgesia. There was no difference between ketamine and placebo when nitrous oxide was used. Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative opioid consumption over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine equivalents, 19% lower than morphine equivalents consumed by participants given placebo (moderate-quality studies). Over 48 hours, opioid consumption was 13 mg lower (moderate quality studies). Ketamine reduced postoperative pain by 6/100 mm on the visual analogue scale at 24 hours (high quality studies), at 24 to 48 hours (moderate studies), and at 48 to 48 (high studies). Pain during movement was reduced by 14% during movement at 24 and 48 hours. Pain after movement was 16% lower with ketamine than with placebo. Overall, 187/3614 participants receiving ketamine experienced an adverse event, compared with 122/2924 (4%) who received placebo. The evidence is current to June 2016. We downgraded the evidence once if numbers were large but small study effects were present, or twice if numbers of participants were small and small-study effects were likely but testing was not possible.
----------------------------------------
 This review found five trials of MSP/RESA vaccine with 217 participants in Papua New Guinea. No severe or systemic adverse effects were reported at doses of 13 to 15 µg of each antigen (39 to 45 µg total). One small efficacy trial with 17 non-immune participants with blood-stage parasites showed no reduction or delay in parasite growth rates after artificial challenge. In the second efficacy trial in 120 children aged five to nine years, episodes of clinical malaria were not reduced, but MSP andRESA significantly reduced parasite density only in children who had not been pretreated with an antimalarial drug (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine). Infections were reduced in children with MSP2 parasite subtype FC27, while those with FC27 were not (720 participants). The results show promise as a way to reduce the severity of malaria episodes, but the effect is MSP 2 variant-specific. Pretreatment for malaria during a vaccine trial makes the results difficult to interpret, particularly with the relatively small sample sizes of early trials.
----------------------------------------
 This systematic review of four studies, involving 125 participants, found that electromagnetic field stimulation may offer some benefit in the treatment of delayed union of long bone fractures, but it is inconclusive and insufficient to inform current practice. More definitive conclusions on treatment effect await further well-conducted randomised controlled trials.
----------------------------------------
 This systematic review identified 12 randomised clinical trials with a total of 1831 participants. The average age of the participants ranged from 48 years to 63 years in 10 of these studies. The proportion of females ranged from 55.0 to 79.0% in 11 studies that provided this information. There was no significant difference between the drain group and the 'no drain' group (2/841) (0.2%) or short-term mortality between these two groups. There were no significant differences between these groups (1/840 participants) (1.1%) or the length of hospital stay between the two groups (3.5 days). There was not enough information from one study to tell us if there was a difference between drain versus no drain for serious adverse events. There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further well designed clinical trials are necessary.
----------------------------------------
 This systematic review found no evidence that Chinese herbal medicines are effective for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, there is insufficient evidence that they are safe. Most of the included trials were of very low methodological quality and therefore any positive findings should be made with caution. No well-designed, randomised, placebo controlled trial with objective outcome measures has been conducted. Conclusions cannot be drawn from this review about the safety of herbal medicines, due to inadequate reporting.
----------------------------------------
 We found five randomized controlled studies involving 1382 patients. All of these studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small numbers and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found that there were no significant differences in biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL) between IAS versus CAS for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. For patients with a Gleason score > 6, reduction of biochemical progression favoured the IAS group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, P = 0.02). However, IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. One study found no difference in adverse effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia) between the two groups, with the exception of impotence, which was significantly lower in patients treated with IAS. Overall, the effectiveness of IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%).
----------------------------------------
 We found 12 trials involving 7,119 women. Five trials randomised women to either immediate or delayed insertion of IUD. One of them showed immediate insertion of the Copper 7 was associated with a higher risk of expulsion than was delayed insertion. Another study showed discontinuation rates due to pregnancy were likely to be higher for women in the Nova T group. However, at six months postabortion, IUD use was higher following immediate insertion compared to delayed insertion, as was expulsion rates. Seven trials examined immediate insertion only. From meta-analysis of two multicentre trials, pregnancy was less likely for the TCu 220C versus the Lippes Loop. In other work, adding copper sleeves improved efficacy and reduced expulsion. Moderate quality evidence shows that insertion of an IUD immediately after abortion is safe and practical.
----------------------------------------
 We found only one small randomised controlled trial published as an abstract article. The included study investigated meditation practice on patients newly hospitalised with acute leukaemia. Ninety-one participants were enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the trial throughout the six-month follow-up period and were eligible for analysis. There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population. We found that meditation practice might be beneficial for the quality of life of haematologically-diseased patients, with higher scores for participants in the mediation arms compared to the participants in usual care control group (low quality of evidence). Levels of depression decreased for those practising meditation in both the spiritually-framed meditation group and the secular-focused meditation group in comparison to the usual care group, whose levels of depression remained constant. However, there was not enough information on the effects of meditation on overall survival, fatigue, anxiety, quality of sleep, adverse events and adverse events, as these outcomes were not evaluated in the included study. More high quality randomised trials are needed.
----------------------------------------
 We found three small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. These small trials suggest varicella vaccine administered within three days to children following household contact with a varicellas case reduces infection rates. Of the vaccine recipients, the majority only had mild disease (with fewer than 50 skin lesions). In the three trials, most participants received PEP within three to five days following exposure; too few participants were vaccinated four or five days post-exposure for us to be able to assess the efficacy of vaccine given more than three days after exposure. No included trial reported on adverse events following immunisation. We identified no RCTs for adolescents or adults. Safety was not adequately addressed.
----------------------------------------
 We found 12 randomised clinical trials with 4704 participants that compared different antibiotic regimens with each other. There was not enough evidence from these studies for us to be able to combine their results. There were no significant differences between the seven different antibiotics used to prevent MRSA infections. Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreased the proportion of people developing MRSA infection compared with placebo in people without malignant disease undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence to suggest that using a combination of multiple prophylactic antibiotics or administering prophyle antibiotics for an increased duration is of benefit to people undergoing surgery. Well designed RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness of different antibiotics are necessary on this topic.
----------------------------------------
 We found two small randomised controlled trials (116 women) comparing planned home care versus hospital management for PPROM. There was insufficient evidence to show whether there were differences between the two groups for perinatal mortality, serious maternal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight and admission to neonatal intensive care. However, there was some evidence that women managed in hospital were more likely to be delivered by caesarean section. Mothers randomised to care at home spent approximately 10 fewer days as inpatients (mean difference -9.60, 95% CI -14.59 to -4.61). Furthermore, home care was associated with reduced costs. The review included two relatively small studies that did not have sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences between groups. Future large and adequately powered trials are required to measure important pre-specified outcomes. Special attention should be given to maternal satisfaction with care and cost analysis as they will have social and economic implications in both developed and developing countries.
----------------------------------------
 This review found no conclusive evidence about how the skin should be closed after caesarean section. The two methods that have been most often compared are non-absorbable staples and absorbable subcutaneous sutures. These two are the most commonly studied methods for skin closure. Compared with absorbables, staples are associated with similar incidences of wound infection. Other important secondary outcomes, such as wound complications, were also similar between these two methods. However, it is important to note, for both of these outcomes (wound infection and wound complication), staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of skin incision, i.e., Pfannenstiel or vertical.
----------------------------------------
 We found 11 randomised controlled trials with 821 participants. Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention. Green tea was found to produce favourable effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure (systolic blood pressure) over six months, but only a small number of studies contributed to each analysis and studies were at risk of bias. Black tea was also found to have favourable effects. When both tea types were analysed together they showed favourable effects in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and blood pressure. Green and black tea were associated with adverse events, but these were unlikely to be directly attributable to the intervention. No studies measured cardiovascular events. There are very few long-term studies to date examining green or black tea for the primary prevention of CVD. The limited evidence suggests that tea has favourable effects for reducing CVD risk factors, but due to the small number that contributed data for each analysis the results should be treated with some caution and further high quality trials are needed to confirm this.
----------------------------------------
 This review identified two small studies that compared azathioprine to placebo in people with chronic asthma. The studies did not provide enough data to be able to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of azathiprine as a steroid sparing agent. Currently there is a clear lack of evidence to support its use in the treatment for people with asthma. Large, long-term studies with pre-defined steroid reducing protocols are required before recommendations for clinical practice can be made.
----------------------------------------
 This review identified 56 studies involving 4068 participants. The majority were carried out with breast cancer (28 studies). The results show that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours. However, there is a need for further research to determine the optimal type, intensity and timing of an exercise intervention.
----------------------------------------
 We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared first-line chemotherapy with second-line treatment. We found five randomised clinical studies, which included 3427 people. These studies were carried out over three years ago. The studies were conducted in Germany, Italy, Belgium, Italy and Belgium. We included one new study (EORTC 20012) in our review. The evidence is current up to August 2016. The EORTC study was carried out in Belgium and involved 3142 participants. The overall risk was low for overall survival (OS) but was high for other outcomes, as treatment blinding was not feasible. The remaining 'Risk of bias' domains were low and unclear. The included studies showed an increase in survival and progression-free survival (PFS). This means that only 90 of every 100 patients will die after five years, compared with 120 people who received the first treatment. This survival advantage is also reflected by an increased PFS with BEACOPP escalated. However, there is only low-quality evidence that there is no difference with respect between second solid tumour types (MDS or AML) between treatment groups. There is also no evidence for a difference between treatment-related mortality (2700 people). Although MDS and AML may be more common in patients treated in this group, it is not clear whether there is any difference between these two groups of people. We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile due to chemotherapy and how many women might be favoured in which treatment group. No analysis was provided of male fertility. Five studies reported side-effects. The analysis shows more haematological toxicities in people treated with escalated BEACopP. This means there is not enough information to be certain about whether these side effects are important. The quality was low or very low for all outcomes. This is mainly because the number was too small for us to be sure of the results.
----------------------------------------
 We found 15 studies including 1835 cancer patients. All included studies were conducted in high income countries. Most studies were aimed at breast and prostate cancer patients (seven studies). Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours. Results indicated low quality evidence of similar RTW rates for psycho education compared to care as usual (low quality evidence). We did not find any studies on vocational interventions. In one study breast cancer patients were offered a physical training programme. Low quality evidence suggested that physical training was not more effective in improving RTW (low-quality evidence) or quality of life. Five studies involved multidisciplinary interventions in which vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, biofeedback-assisted behavioral training and/or physical exercises were combined. We found moderate quality evidence that multidisulatory interventions enhance the RTW of patients with cancer. In all studies a less radical, functioning conserving medical intervention was compared with a more radical treatment. Moderate quality evidence showed no difference in the effect on RTW.
----------------------------------------
 We found four trials involving more than 13,000 women in labour. Three of these trials were funded by the hospitals where they took place and one trial was funded in part by the Scottish government. All four included trials were conducted in developed Western European countries. The evidence is current up to June 2014. The studies were of moderate quality. We found no new studies in this update. The four trials we found were of low to very low quality. There was no clear difference between women who received an admission CTG and women who did not. However, there was an increase of caesarean section rates in women who had a CTG compared to women given intermittent auscultation. Women who received the CTG had higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour, fetal blood sampling during labour (low quality evidence). There were no differences between groups of women in other secondary outcome measures, for example, the incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, seizures in the neonatal period and severe neurodevelopmental disability assessed at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age. The data did not show an important difference between groups in perinatal mortality. The trials did not have enough data to show if there were important differences between the two groups. It is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be able to detect any important differences. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate or very low. Evidence quality ranged from very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about whether or not the results are reliable. The findings of this review support recommendations for women who are low-risk in labour to not be given CTG. Women should be informed about the risks associated with the use of CTG, as there is no evidence that it is beneficial or harmful. Future studies should consider including women admitted in labour with signs of labour. This would include women currently having admission CTGs and not included in current trials. One additional study is ongoing.
----------------------------------------
 We found 32 randomised controlled studies (over 15,230 women). Seventeen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles and twelve randomised oocytes. No two studies compared the same culture media and none of them found any evidence of a difference between the culture media used. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy. Four of these studies found no evidence that there was a difference in the media used, for either day three or day five embryo transfer. The data from the fifth study did not appear to be reliable. Six studies reported clinical pregnancy rate. One of these found a difference for cleavage stage embryo transfer, suggesting that Quinn's Advantage was associated with higher clinical pregnancy rates than G5 (odds ratio (OR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12 to 2.16; 692 women). This study was available only in an abstract. The quality was low. With regards to adverse effects, three studies reported multiple pregnancies and six studies reported miscarriage. None of the studies found evidence to support or refute any specific culture medium. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low for nearly all comparisons, the main limitations being imprecision of study methods and poor reporting. Most studies (22/32) did not report their source of funding and none described their methodology in adequate detail. We conclude that there is not enough evidence on which to base decisions about which culture medium is best to use in IVF or ICSI treatment. Properly designed randomised trials are necessary.
----------------------------------------
 This review aimed to find out if there were any studies in this area. However, there were no randomised controlled trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for the diagnosis. The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice. As some papers reviewed by the authors related to the first consultation visit, where treatment options are discussed, perhaps a review which focused on the methods of communication at the first consultative visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods to communicate and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned.
----------------------------------------
 We found 17 randomised controlled studies with 1006 people with NSCP. The evidence is current to February 2015. We found that psychological interventions reduce chest pain in the first three to nine months following the intervention. There was also an increase in the number of chest pain-free days up to three months after treatment. However, there was not enough evidence that there was an effect on chest pain frequency, and there was no evidence of a difference in chest pain severity up to one year after the treatment. We did not find any evidence that the interventions had an effect for other brief interventions, such as hypnotherapy or cognitive-behavioural interventions. In addition, there were too few studies to be sure that these interventions were effective. More research is needed.
----------------------------------------
 We found 30 trials with 4344 participants that compared topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers with placebo (dummy treatment). The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). The quality of the studies was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with only one to eight-week follow-up. There was some evidence to support that topical anti-histamines (nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, levocabastine, emedastine (or levocablastine), mequitamines, bephenazine, azelasulfonazole, mipetazole and tetryzoline. However, there was no long-term data on their efficacy. There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use. Overall, it seems that all of these drugs appear to be safe and well-tolerated.
----------------------------------------
 The review of two studies found that there is not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of community-based tobacco prevention interventions aimed at preventing tobacco use among Indigenous youth. However, there is a significant health gap between Indigenous youth and non-Indigenous youth where Indigenous populations, a minority, are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. More research is needed in this area.
----------------------------------------
 This review found one small randomised controlled trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS). The evidence is up-to-date to May 2013. The included trial did not show any clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality or markers of severe maternal morbidity (pulmonary embolism, congestive cardiac failure, acute chest syndrome, haemolytic crises or delayed blood transfusion reaction) between women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusions. However, there were few events reported in the trial. The trial was at unclear risk of bias and the results were generally imprecise. Low-quality evidence from one small trial of very low quality suggests no clear clinical benefits when compared with selective transfusion. Currently, there is no evidence from randomised or quasi-randomised trials to provide reliable advice for women with HbSC or HbSβThal. The available data on this subject are insufficient to advocate for a change in existing clinical practice and policy.
----------------------------------------
 We found 67 randomised clinical trials (RCTs), involving 6197 people, that compared radiofrequency dissecting sealer to the clamp-crush method. The evidence is up-to-date to June 2014. A total of 5771 people from 64 trials provided data for one or more outcomes included in this review. There was no evidence of differences in most of the comparisons, and where there was, these differences were small. The only difference we found from more than one study was the number of side-effects (complications), which was higher with radiofrequency dissections. In addition, it should be noted that we cannot be sure that there was a difference between the two methods because there was only one small study and the sample size was small. There is no evidence to suggest that using special equipment for liver resection is of any benefit in reducing mortality, morbidity, blood transfusion requirements, blood loss, total hospital stay, and operating time. However, there is low-quality evidence of increased harm without any evidence of benefits. The quality was low or very low for all comparisons. We did not find sufficient data to be able to say whether there was any difference between these two methods. The included studies were too small to allow us to be certain whether there were differences between them. We summarise only the evidence that was available in one study below.
----------------------------------------
 This systematic review found 23 trials involving 724 people that investigated different treatments for PPP. Many different interventions were reported to produce "improvement". There is, however, no standardised method for assessing response to treatment, and reductions in pustule counts or other empirical semi-quantitative scoring systems may be of little relevance to the patient. There is no evidence to suggest that short-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) is effective. It would also appear that low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics and Grenz Ray Therapy may be useful treatments. Colchicine has a lot of side effects and it is unclear if it is effective and neither was topical PUVA.
----------------------------------------
 We found nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of loop diuretic drugs in 460 people who had baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg. We found no evidence that these drugs lower blood pressure by more than 8.8 weeks. The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood pressure lowering effect was -7.9 (-10.4 to -5.4) mmHG/ -4.4 (-5.9 to -2.8%) mmHGs. Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference. The review did not provide a good estimate of harms associated with these drugs because we did not find enough studies. The quality was low.
----------------------------------------
 We found 58 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation (1558 participants) versus control (1291 participants). Local anaesthetic instillation was used in 48 trials with 2849 participants. Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were considerable differences between the methods and timing (before or after the removal) between the trials. There was very low-quality evidence that local anaesthesia instillation reduced pain and length of hospital stay. However, there was not enough evidence to say if this is important or not. Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetics. There is very low quality evidence that it reduces pain in low anaesthesia risk people having elective surgery for gallbladder removal. The evidence is up-to-date to August 2016. Further randomised clinical studies are necessary. Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life, return to normal activity, and time to return to work in their assessment.
----------------------------------------
 We found 74 studies that evaluated RDTs for P. falciparum malaria. The studies were of different types, so we could not combine their results. We found no differences between the types of RDT in terms of sensitivity, specificity, or quality between studies. We also found some differences between studies in how the studies were carried out, which may have affected our results. For example, most studies did not report enough information about how they were done, so it was not possible for us to be sure if they were accurate or not. However, there were some studies in which the data were not reported clearly enough, which might have affected how well they were performed. The sensitivity of all the RDT types was high enough that they can replace or extend the access to diagnostic services for uncomplicated malaria. For pLDH antibody-based RDT tests, we found that HRP-2 antibodies may be more sensitive but are less specific. The HRP 2 antigen persists even after effective treatment and so is not useful for detecting treatment failures. The number of people wrongly diagnosed would be 34 with Type 1 tests, and nine with Type 4 tests.
----------------------------------------
 We found five studies that tested short-term changes in the consultation time allocated to each patient. All were conducted in the UK, all were of very low methodological quality. Most studies had a high risk of bias, particularly due to non-random allocation of participants and small sample sizes. We are uncertain whether altering appointment length increases primary care consultation length, number of referrals and investigations, prescriptions, or patient satisfaction based on very low-certainty evidence. We did not find sufficient evidence to support or refute a policy of altering the length of primary care physicians' consultations. It is possible that these findings may change if high-quality trials are reported in the future. Further studies are needed that focus on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness.
----------------------------------------
 This systematic review identified only three small trials that evaluated virologic efficacy and safety of high dose versus low dose stavudine. All three trials were conducted in developed countries (Milinkovic 2007, McComsey 2008, Sanchez-Conde 2005). All three studies were at high risk for bias. A total of 157 participants were recruited to these studies. Participants were ART experienced and all had sustained viral suppression at baseline. The studies were small and of low methodological quality, so it was not possible to combine their results. There was no clear difference between the two groups of participants. Some baseline characteristics differed among the groups, including triglyceride levels in two studies, body mass index in one study, bone mineral density (BMD), reduction in limb fat in the high dose group and an increase of triglycerides. Symptomatic hyperlactatemia was seen in only one study and was not reported in the other two studies. The included studies did not show that any participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Individual results from these trials were imprecise and have not identified a clear advantage over low dose in virologia. Furthermore, enrolled participants were treatment experienced with sustained virus suppression and so existing data cannot be generalized to settings where stovudine is currently used in ART naive patients with high viral loads.
----------------------------------------
 We found 10 trials (n = 1658 participants). We found five trials to be at low risk of bias and five at moderate risk. Six trials included recruitment manoeuvres as part of an open lung ventilation strategy that was different from control ventilation in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre (such as mode of ventilation, higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration and lower tidal volume or plateau pressure). Six studies reported mortality outcomes. Pooled data from five trials (1370 participants) showed no difference between groups of people with ARDS who received an open-lung ventilation strategy and those who received control ventilation. Data from four studies (1313 people) showed that there was no difference in the number of people who died within 28 days of hospital admission. Data revealed that there were no differences between the groups. The quality of evidence was low because of differences between studies. The evidence is up-to-date to May 2018.
----------------------------------------
 This review identified 15 studies, involving 687 participants, which assessed the effects of psychological interventions in adults with asthma. Most studies did not show significant differences between relaxation therapy and control. However, some studies did show that relaxation therapy reduced the use of 'as needed' medications and improved quality of life. This review was not able to draw firm conclusions about the role of these techniques for the treatment of asthma due to a lack of evidence. Larger, well-conducted and reported randomised trials are required in this area, in order to determine whether these techniques are effective for treating asthma in adults.
----------------------------------------
 This systematic review included 35 studies, including 6785 participants, comparing antidepressants with benzodiazepines. We found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference between antidepressants in terms of response rate or dropouts due to any cause in people with panic disorder. Very low quality evidence suggested that there was no difference in dropout rates between antidepressants (215 participants) compared to antidepressants, but there was some evidence that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are better tolerated than TCAs (when looking at adverse effects). We did not find clinically significant differences between individual antidepressants. The majority of studies did not report details about random sequence generation and allocation concealment; similarly, no details were provided about strategies to ensure blinding. The study protocol was not available for almost all studies, so it is difficult for us to make a judgement about the possibility of outcome reporting bias. Information on adverse effects was very limited. The present review highlights the need for further higher-quality studies, which should be conducted with high-quality methods and including pragmatic outcome measures to provide clinicians with useful and practical data. Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.
----------------------------------------
 This review found 29 randomised controlled trials involving over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. Endoscopic stenting with plastic stent was associated with a reduced risk of complications, but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04). One published study compared metal stents with surgery and reported lower costs and better quality of life with metal stent. The addition of an anti-reflux valve improved the patency of Teflon stents. When different types were compared to polyethylene stents, only perflouro alkoxy stents had superior outcomes in one trial. There were no significant differences in risk of technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30 day mortality by meta-analysis. In patients with short predicted survival, their patency benefits may not be realised. Further RCTs are needed to determine the optimal stent type for these patients.
----------------------------------------
 We found five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 444 participants. Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound guidance with Doppler auditory assistance. We found that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt and fewer complications in children in whom arterial line cannulation is more difficult than in older children. We also found better success rates within two attempts with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance. No studies reported data about ischaemic damage. Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children. Similarly, our results suggest that there may be a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt. The evidence is up-to-date as December 2016. The quality of the evidence was moderate due to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, small sample sizes and limited numbers of events.
----------------------------------------
 We found one small randomised controlled study (80 male student participants conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2009), three ITS studies, two ITS studies in Canada, one ITS study (general population studies in Canadian provinces conducted in 1970s and 80s) and one study in Australia. None of these studies were funded by the alcohol industry. Two ITS studies evaluated the implementation of an advertising ban on all forms of alcohol advertising. One ITS study evaluated a different type of ban (partial or full) compared with different degrees of restrictions or no restrictions during the control period. The results were inconsistent. One of the ITS studies showed an overall mean non-significant increase in beer and wine consumption of 1.10% following a ban. The other two studies showed no difference in alcohol consumption. The third ITS study showed that alcohol sales decreased by 11.11 kilolitres per month after a partial ban was lifted. In this study, beer sales increased by 14.89 and 1.15 kilolitre per month, respectively. No other prespecified outcomes (including economic loss or hardship due to decreased alcohol sales) were addressed in the included studies. No adverse effects were reported in the studies. The quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to a serious risk of bias, serious indirectness, serious imprecision in the results of the studies and serious level (very low-quality) of evidence. There is not enough evidence for or against recommending a ban on alcohol advertising restrictions. More high-quality research is needed in this area.

 This review found no evidence of difference between MCT and LCT on short-term growth, gastrointestinal intolerance, or necrotizing enterocolitis. However, there is conflicting evidence that there is no evidence that either formula type can improve short term growth or have less adverse effects. Further studies are necessary because the results from the included eight studies are imprecise due to small numbers and do not address important long-term outcomes.

 We found one small trial (with data from 34 women) comparing transcervical amnioinfusion with a control group. All women received an intrauterine pressure catheter, acetaminophen and antibiotics (ampicillin or, if receiving Group B beta streptococcal prophylaxis, penicillin and gentamycin). The study did not include any trials that used transabdominal amniotic fluid. The study was small and did not have enough women to be sure whether it was effective or not. The evidence is up to date as February 2018. The trial did not report any information about how many babies died or were admitted to intensive or high care. It did not provide information about whether there was any difference between the two groups of women, nor did it report how many women had low Apgar scores at five minutes after birth. There was no clear difference between these two groups on postpartum endometritis, neonatal infection, caesarean section rates, duration of antibiotic treatment, maternal antibiotic treatment or the time women spent in hospital. We did not find any studies that looked at whether there were any risks to women’s safety or satisfaction with this treatment. We found only one small study of interest in this review. This study was at a very small size, so it is not possible for us to make any conclusions about whether this treatment is beneficial or harmful to women or the baby. The included study did, however, show that there was no difference between those women who received transcervicals compared with those who did not. Women who received this treatment had a lower temperature at the time they gave it, but it was not clear whether it had an effect. The quality was low, meaning that we were very uncertain about the results. There is not enough evidence to be certain about whether or not this treatment works. More studies are needed.

 This review identified three studies, with a total of 1620 participants, comparing the Mini-Cog with other cognitive screening tests in community settings. The studies were of poor methodological quality, so it was difficult to combine the results of these studies. There is a need for further well-designed studies comparing this diagnostic test to other brief cognitive screening test in community based settings.

 We found 19 studies involving 2521 participants that compared amphetamines to placebo, lisdexamfetamine, dexamphetamine, or mixed amphetamine salts. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands, Turkey, Israel, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and Turkey. Most studies had a short follow-up period of 5.3 weeks. All studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The average age of participants was 35.3 years, most were middle-aged Caucasian males (57.2%) with ADHD. We found no studies that had low risk of bias, mainly because we found no evidence that amphetamine treatment improved ADHD symptom severity, but also because we could not rule out the possibility of a carry-over effect in studies that used a cross-over design. In addition, we found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in the severity of ADHD symptoms between the three types of amphetamine drugs. Amphetamines were effective in reducing ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians. However, there were no clear differences between amphetamine types in terms of side-effects. Adverse events: we found that there were more patients who withdrew from these studies because of adverse events compared to placebo (17 studies, 2323 people). We found low to very low quality evidence for all of these outcomes. Overall, the quality was low or very low.
----------------------------------------
 We found 10 studies, with 811 participants, comparing vitamin D with placebo or no treatment. The studies were heterogeneous with regard to study quality, the chronic painful conditions that were investigated, the dose of vitamin D given, co-interventions, the outcome measures reported. Only two studies reported responder pain outcomes; the other studies reported treatment group average outcomes only. Overall, there was no consistent pattern that vitamin D treatment was better than placebo in any chronic painful condition (low quality evidence). Adverse events and withdrawals were comparatively infrequent, with no consistent difference between vitamin D and placebo (good quality of evidence). Based on this evidence, a large beneficial effect is unlikely. Whether vitamin D can have beneficial effects in specific chronic pain conditions needs further investigation.
----------------------------------------
 This review identified 40 studies involving more than 200 health professionals and 48,000 patients. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes. In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted. In 12 studies the interventions were targeted at health professionals, in nine they were targeted by the organisation of care and 20 studies targeted both. In 15 studies patient education was added to professional and organisational interventions. A combination of professional interventions improved process outcomes. The effect on patient outcomes remained less clear, as these were rarely assessed. Arrangements for follow-up (organisational intervention) also showed a favourable effect on patients' health outcomes. Multifaceted professional interventions can enhance the performance of health professionals in managing patients with diabetes. Organisational interventions that improve regular prompted recall and review of patients (central computerised tracking systems or nurses who regularly contact the patient) can also improve diabetes management. Nurses can play an important role in patient-oriented interventions, through patient education or facilitating adherence to treatment.

 We found five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which included 1503 women aged 25 years old or younger. The trials compared hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods to each other or to another type of birth control method. The evidence is up-to-date to February 2016. The studies compared the following methods: combined oral contraceptive (COC) versus transdermal contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or levonorgestrel intra-uterine system 20 µg/day (LNG-IUS 20); LNG 12 versus LNG 16; and LNG 20 versus the copper T380A intrauterin device (IUD). The trials did not show any difference in contraceptive efficacy or continuation. The only significant outcome was that a COC group had a higher proportion of women who discontinued for 'other personal reasons', which may have little clinic relevance. In the trials comparing two different types of methods, the study arms did not differ significantly for contraceptive efficacy. The sample sizes were small for two of those studies. The trial comparing different LNGs showed a similar efficacy over one to three years. In another study, continuation was at least 75% for the LNG at 6 to 36 months. Different doses did not appear to influence efficacy over three-year follow-up. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low. Limitations were due to trial design or limited reporting.

 This systematic review of allergen immunotherapy trials found that immunotherapy reduces asthma symptoms and use of asthma medications and improves bronchial hyper-reactivity. There was no consistent effect of immunotherapy on lung function.
----------------------------------------
 This review found no new studies which were eligible for inclusion. The total number of studies remained unchanged, six trials involving 1297 patients. Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation with a relative risk of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.88); hospital mortality was reduced with a RR 0.80 (95%, 95% CI 0.69, 0.92). Overall mortality was not significantly different if a plateau pressure less than or equal to 31 cm H2O was used. The effects on long-term mortality are unknown, although the possibility of a clinically relevant benefit cannot be excluded. Ventilation with lower tidal volumes is becoming a routine strategy of treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury, stopping investigators from carrying out additional trials.
----------------------------------------
 We found 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1833 participants. The evidence is up-to-date as September 2013. We found no high-quality evidence that isoflurane delayed emergence from anaesthesia compared to propofol. However, we found evidence of low quality of evidence that the intravenous technique is comparable with the inhalational technique to provide early emergence from anesthetics. Adverse events with both techniques are also comparable. The findings should be interpreted with caution. Randomized controlled trials based on uniform and standard methods are needed. Researchers should follow proper methods of randomization and blinding, and trials should be adequately powered.

 This is an injury to the fifth metacarpal.
----------------------------------------
 This is the result of an examination. The fracture was found in a small section of the back bone and is of moderate size, measuring approximately 4 cm in length. There is no evidence to suggest that this fracture is serious or life threatening. It is not known how long it will take for this fracture to heal.
----------------------------------------
 This review found no evidence to support the use of endosteal scalloping and minimal expansion.
----------------------------------------
 This review of the evidence found no evidence to support the existence of an enchondroma.
----------------------------------------
 This is a fracture in the fifth metacarpal shaft of the middle and distal thirds of the fifth hand. The fracture is not thought to be serious.
